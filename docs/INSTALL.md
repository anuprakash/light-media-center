# Light Media Center Installation Guide #

This guide provides installation steps assuming you are using a Debian Linux distribution on <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A20/A20-OLinuXIno-LIME2/">OLinuxino A20 LIME2</a>.
Note that all install procedures that are easy and safe to automate have been included in the Light Media Center makefile as install-SOMETHING targets; however tasks that are non-trivial to automate or strongly dependent upon the specific Linux distribution version or 3rd party software versions are instead listed here as manual steps.
